# ThreatX - DevOps Homework Project
## Introduction 
As a DevOps Engineer at ThreatX you will be responsible for the care and feeding of the infrastructure-as-code that hosts our services. To simulate that type of role, we invite you to consider the situation of deploying a new sample web service through automation. 

## Context
We are a Linux shop and run in many providers such as AWS, IBM, INAP, and more. Our services are primarily written in Rust, and deployed with Python. We currently use tools like Docker, Jenkins, Consul, Nginx and Ansible to build and deploy. You are not required to use these technologies in your submission. We’ll do our best to evaluate whatever you provide. Of course the easier it is for us to run your submission, the more likely we are to be able to properly evaluate it. 

## Problem 
Using your preferred technologies, please provide a reference infrastructure-as-code of the sample application (`bldrtech/filewcount`). The focus of this exercise is on the orchestration necessary for deploying the sample application **as a service** in whatever means you define with an eye on **key properties**:

* Load Balancing
* Observability
* Service Upgrade Strategy
* Testing and Documentation

## Deliverables 
We ask for these deliverables (committed to a new branch in this repository, submit PR when ready for review): 
* Your implementation of the sample application as a service (a.k.a. "infrastructure as code")
* Documentation on the service, including how we can actually setup, test, and upgrade the service
* An overview document describing your submission. It may include questions you would have asked, assumptions that you needed to make, and reasoning behind your decisions.


## FAQs

### How should \<insert requirement> work?
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. In software engineering, requirements gathering can be just as important as the coding itself.

However, we understand that you have limited time for this homework project and you may need to make decisions quickly on nights and weekends. If questions arise, or you feel that information is missing, and for whatever reason you are not able to clarify the requirements effectively, please make your own logical assumptions and decisions in order to move on with the project. You can explain those design details and thought processes in the overview document included with the submission.

### How much time should I spend? 
#### Short answer: 
Spend a few hours getting something working and turn it in. If not satisfied with it yet, spend an extra few hours, and then turn it in. 

#### Longer answer: 
Here at ThreatX, we’re trying to do what makes sense, instead of what’s always been done before. One of the things that makes sense to us is seeing what you can do, not just assessing what you can talk about. So, make the most of this opportunity. It’s a great way to show off what you’re good at! 

Your submission is a starting point for a richer conversation about what you can do, how you like to do it, and how your talents can be best put to use at ThreatX.

If that seems too big an ask it does not automatically mean that you are not qualified to work with us. Please, feel free to narrow the scope, or spend a bit more time iterating on your solution. We will ask you to set a deadline that you can meet while working at your own pace. 

Cheat code: Mostly, people do this work in a couple of evenings, or over a weekend. 


Good luck, and have fun!
